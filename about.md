I am a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, where I conduct research in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and quantum acoustodynamics. My work focuses on enhancing the lifetime of superconducting qubits by carefully engineering the phononic environment.
